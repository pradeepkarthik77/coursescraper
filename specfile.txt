Simultaneously, we consider the data that are used to construct such estimates. We then consider the role of social determinants and risk factors in shaping the distribution of disease in populations. For each, the overall aetiology and epidemiological patterns are described and subsequently, the interventions that are available to combat them are considered. Particular \u2018policy issues\u2019 in relation to each disease are examined from multiple angles. Each session comprises lecture content with leaders in the field, practical activities and in-depth interview with subject matter experts. The specialisation will give students a broad understanding of the major global issues in health and an in-depth understanding of some of the most important disease challenges that are being faced today. It will equip public health professionals and researchers with a broad foundation of knowledge on which to build further expertise about global public health.",

This Specialization is designed to provide career relevant knowledge and skills for anyone wanting to pursue a job role in domains such as Data Engineering, Data Management, BI or Data Analytics. The program consists of four online courses. In the first course you learn the basics of SQL and how to query relational databases with this powerful language. Next you learn to use essential Linux commands and create basic shell scripts. You continue your journey by learning to build and automate ETL, ELT and data pipelines using BASH scripts, Apache Airflow and Apache Kafka. In the final course you learn about Data Lakes, Data Marts as well as work with Data Warehouses. You also create interactive reports and dashboards to derive insights from data in your warehouse. Note that this specialization has a significant emphasis on hands-on practice employing real tools used by data professionals. Every course has numerous hands-on labs as well as a course project. While you will benefit from some prior programming experience, it is not absolutely necessary for this course. The only pre-requisites for this specialization are basic computer and data literacy, and a passion to self-learn online.",

Six Sigma skills are widely sought by employers both nationally and internationally. These skills have been proven to help improve business processes, performance, and quality assurance.\n\nIn this specialization, you will learn proven principles and tools specific to six sigma and lean.\n\nThis is a sequential, linear designed specialization that covers the introductory level content (at the \"yellow belt\" level) of Six Sigma and Lean. Yellow Belt knowledge is needed before advancing to Green Belt (which is a second specialization offered here on Coursera by the USG). Green Belt knowledge is needed before moving to a Black Belt.\n\nThe proper sequence of this specialization is:\n\nCourse #1 - Six Sigma Fundamentals\n\nCourse #2 - Six Sigma Tools for Define and Measure\n\nCourse #3 - Six Sigma Tools for Analyze\n\nCourse #4 - Six Sigma Tools for Improve and Control\n\nAt the end of Course #4 (Six Sigma Tools for Improve and Control), there is a peer-reviewed, capstone project. Successful completion of this project is necessary for full completion of this specialization.\n\nIt should be noted that completing either the Yellow Belt or Green Belt Specializations does not give the learner \"professional accreditation\" in Six Sigma.

They figure heavily in our language, food, clothing, family structure, economy, education, entertainment, science, recreation, and other areas of social life. In this specialization, we will investigate a range of topics, many of them controversial. Although this is a sociology course, the field of human-animal studies is interdisciplinary. Many of the suggested readings come from fields outside of sociology, but this specialization emphasizes their sociological relevance throughout each course.",

With generative design, there is no single solution. Instead, there are multiple great solutions. You choose the design that best fits your needs.\n\nGenerative design is a design exploration process. Designers or engineers input design goals into the software, along with parameters such as performance or spatial requirements, materials, manufacturing methods, and cost constraints. The software explores all the possible permutations of a solution, quickly generating design alternatives. It tests and learns from each iteration what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nThrough this specialization, you\u2019ll learn the foundations of product innovation and generative design while developing your skills in Autodesk\u00ae Fusion 360\u2122.\n\nPlus, by completing this Specialization, you\u2019ll unlock an additional Autodesk Credential as further recognition of your success! The Autodesk Credential comes with a digital badge and certificate, which you can add to your resume and share on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a paid subscription to Fusion 360 to complete the assignments in this course.

These data stores are cost-efficient and infinitely scalable.\n\nTo query these huge datasets in clusters and cloud storage, you need a newer breed of SQL engine: distributed query engines, like Hive, Impala, Presto, and Drill. These are open source SQL engines capable of querying enormous datasets. This Specialization focuses on Hive and Impala, the most widely deployed of these query engines.\n\nThis Specialization is designed to provide excellent preparation for the Cloudera Certified Associate (CCA) Data Analyst certification exam.

These programs vary widely but most share a concern for five individual, student competencies: self awareness; self-management; social awareness; relationship skills; and finally responsible decision making. It is important for teachers and parents to know about and understand these programs. While lots of SEL programs emphasize K-12 student social and emotional learning, only a very few programs exist to promote, and help teachers explore their own emotional well-being. In this Specialization our central premise is this:\n\nTo facilitate students\u2019 social and emotional learning, a teacher must know the student as a person. This means that the teacher must strive to know her or him self. In order to help students achieve a degree of well-being, teachers need to be aware of their own well-being.\n\nIn our Specialization, \u201cThe Teacher and SEL\u201d the instructors (Randy Testa and Dan Liston, as well as Emily Price and Ben Kirshner) examine kindergarten through high school SEL programs, looking at both established programs and less well-known community-based and youth empowerment approaches.

However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner) and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice. To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview. We invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs.",

Modern managers must master the art of persuasive communication, adapt to the needs of the audience, construct a good narrative and inspire the audience to act (Communicate with Impact). They must learn to design and negotiate both informal and complex agreements, and do this in diverse workplace cultures (Negotiate and Resolve Conflict).\n\nThe Specialization applies influencing methods in two areas of great importance: change management and risk governance. Successful change management eludes many individuals and organizations, so we propose a new approach to enable you to inspire and lead transformations (Manage Change). Similarly, in the post-financial crisis environment, many organizations acknowledge the need for effective risk governance but few, if any, have achieved it.

Hundreds of plant genomes have been sequenced, RNA-seq has enabled transcriptome-wide expression profiling, and a proliferation of \"-seq\"-based methods has permitted protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to be determined cheaply and in a high-throughput manner. These data sets in turn allow us to generate hypotheses at the click of a mouse or tap of a finger.The Plant Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera introduces core bioinformatic competencies and resources, such as NCBI's Genbank, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics in Bioinformatic Methods I, followed by protein-protein interaction, structural bioinformatics and RNA-seq analysis in Bioinformatic Methods II. In Plant Bioinformatics we cover 33 plant-specific online tools from genome browsers to transcriptomic data mining to promoter/network analyses and others. Last, a Plant Bioinformatics Capstone uses these tools to hypothesize a biological role for a gene of unknown function, summarized in a written lab report.This specialization is useful to any modern plant molecular biologist wanting to get a feeling for the incredible scope of data available to researchers. A small amount of R programming is introduced in Bioinformatic Methods II, but most of the tools are web applications. It is recommended that you have access to a laptop or desktop computer for running these as they may not work as mobile applications on your phone or tablet.",
